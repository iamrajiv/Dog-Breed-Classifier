<h1>Dog-Breed Classifier</h1>
</div>

## Project Overview

In this project, I have learned how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I have made important design decisions about the user experience for the app. By completing this project, I have demonstrated my understanding of the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.
